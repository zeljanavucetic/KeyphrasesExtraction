Keyword and keyphrase extraction is an
important problem in natural language
processing, with applications ranging
from summarization to semantic search
to document clustering. Graph-based approaches
to keyword and keyphrase extraction
avoid the problem of acquiring a
large in-domain training corpus by applying
variants of PageRank algorithm on a
network of words. Although graph-based
approaches are knowledge-lean and easily
adoptable in online systems, it remains
largely open whether they can benefit from
centrality measures other than PageRank.
In this paper, we experiment with an array
of centrality measures on word and
noun phrase collocation networks, and analyze
their performance on four benchmark
datasets. Not only are there centrality
measures that perform as well as or better
than PageRank, but they are much simpler
(e.g., degree, strength, and neighborhood
size). Furthermore, centrality-based
methods give results that are competitive
with and, in some cases, better than two
strong unsupervised baselines.
Keyword and keyphrase extraction is the problem
of automatically identifying important terms in
text documents. These terms provide a high-level
topic description of documents and are shown
to be rich sources of information for applications
such as: online advertising, i.e., displaying
ads based on key terms extracted from webpages
(Grineva et al., 2009); document summarization,
i.e., creating a summary with the most relevant
points in a text (Litvak and Last, 2008); clustering
websites (Tonella et al., 2003); tracking topics in
